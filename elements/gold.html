        <h1>Gold</h1>
        <p><strong>Gold</strong>, symbol <strong>Au</strong>, is a transition metal with atomic number 79. Known for its beauty and rarity, gold has been used by humans for thousands of years for currency, jewelry, and decoration. It is highly prized for its malleability, resistance to corrosion, and distinct yellow color.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Au</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 79</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 196.97</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 19.32 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 1,064 °C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 2,850 °C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Gold is a precious metal that has been formed in supernova explosions and is often found in the Earth's crust. It is used in a variety of applications due to its excellent conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and aesthetic appeal.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jewelry and Decoration:</strong> Gold is widely used in jewelry and ornamentation because of its natural beauty and resistance to tarnishing.</li>
            <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Historically, gold has been used as money and continues to be used in the form of gold coins and bullion.</li>
            <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> Due to its excellent electrical conductivity, gold is used in high-performance connectors and circuit boards.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Gold is so malleable that a single ounce can be stretched into a thread over 50 miles long.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Gold</h2>
        <p>Gold has only one stable isotope, Gold-197, which is widely used in research, including in cancer treatment using gold nanoparticles.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Gold is highly resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It forms compounds such as Gold(I) chloride and Gold(III) chloride, but is largely inert to most acids. It also reacts with chlorine, bromine, and iodine to form various gold halides.</p>
