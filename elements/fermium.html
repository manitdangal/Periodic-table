        <h1>Fermium</h1>
        <p><strong>Fermium</strong>, symbol <strong>Fm</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 100. It was first synthesized in 1952 as a result of the testing of hydrogen bombs. Fermium was named in honor of physicist Enrico Fermi, who made significant contributions to the development of nuclear physics.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Fm</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 100</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 257</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 9.7 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Fermium is a synthetic element and does not naturally occur in the Earth’s crust. It was produced in minute amounts in nuclear reactions, particularly during the testing of hydrogen bombs. While it has no major natural occurrences, its creation has expanded our understanding of heavy elements and their nuclear properties.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its high radioactivity and rarity, Fermium has limited practical applications. It is primarily used in scientific research, particularly in nuclear physics. It has also been used in the study of the synthesis of superheavy elements, expanding our knowledge of nuclear reactions and decay processes.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Fermium was named in honor of Enrico Fermi, a pioneering physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to the development of the theory of nuclear reactions and nuclear energy. His work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Fermium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Fermium is Fermium-257, which has a half-life of about 100.5 days. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives and are unstable, making them difficult to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Fermium are not fully understood due to its short half-lives and limited availability. As an actinide, Fermium is expected to exhibit similar properties to other elements in this series, including a likely +3 oxidation state in its compounds. However, its reactivity and chemical behavior are not well-studied due to the challenges in synthesizing significant amounts for analysis.</p>
