        <h1>Fluorine</h1>
        <p><strong>Fluorine</strong>, symbol <strong>F</strong>, is the ninth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 9. It is the most electronegative and reactive element, a pale yellow-green gas at room temperature. Fluorine is highly toxic and corrosive, forming various compounds like hydrofluoric acid and fluorides.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> F</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 9</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 18.998 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 1.696 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Gas</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> -219.67°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> -188.11°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Fluorine is the 13th most abundant element in Earth's crust and plays an essential role in various biological and chemical processes. It is found in small amounts in minerals, and compounds of fluorine are important in several industrial applications, including water fluoridation and the production of Teflon.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Fluorine has several important uses in various industries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Fluoridation:</strong> Fluorine is commonly added to drinking water to help prevent tooth decay.</li>
            <li><strong>Production of Teflon:</strong> Fluorine is used to produce Teflon, a non-stick coating for cookware and industrial equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Fluorine is used in the production of various drugs, including anesthetics and anti-depressants.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluoride Compounds:</strong> Fluoride compounds are used in toothpaste and in the manufacturing of various chemicals and materials.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Fluorine is so reactive that it can even react with noble gases like xenon, which were previously thought to be chemically inert.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Fluorine is the most electronegative element, meaning it strongly attracts electrons. This high reactivity makes it one of the most powerful oxidizing agents. Some key compounds and reactions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydrofluoric Acid (HF):</strong> Fluorine reacts with hydrogen to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in etching glass and metal cleaning.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluorides:</strong> Fluorine combines with metals and other elements to form fluorides, which are used in various industrial processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluorine in Teflon (PTFE):</strong> The chemical bonds between carbon and fluorine in Teflon give it its non-stick properties and resistance to high temperatures.</li>
        </ul>
