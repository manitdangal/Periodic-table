        <h1>Mendelevium</h1>
        <p><strong>Mendelevium</strong>, symbol <strong>Md</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 101. It was first synthesized in 1955 by Albert Ghiorso and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles. Mendelevium is named after Dmitri Mendeleev, the Russian chemist who created the periodic table.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Md</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 101</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 258</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 8.9 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Mendelevium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally in the Earth's crust. It was created in a laboratory as part of scientific efforts to explore superheavy elements. Its discovery helped expand the periodic table and provided additional insights into the behavior of heavy elements, contributing to the study of the actinide series and nuclear chemistry.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and radioactivity, Mendelevium has no significant commercial applications. It is mainly used for scientific research purposes, particularly in the study of nuclear reactions and the properties of heavy elements. It has also been used in the synthesis of other heavier elements.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Mendelevium was named in honor of Dmitri Mendeleev, who is credited with developing the periodic table of elements, organizing elements based on their atomic weights and properties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Mendelevium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Mendelevium is Mendelevium-258, which has a half-life of about 51.5 days. Other isotopes of Mendelevium have even shorter half-lives and are highly unstable, making them challenging to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Mendelevium are not well understood due to its limited availability and the short half-lives of its isotopes. As an actinide, Mendelevium is expected to exhibit behavior similar to other actinide elements, with a likely +3 oxidation state in its compounds. Its exact chemical behavior remains a subject of study due to the difficulty of synthesizing sufficient quantities for analysis.</p>
