        <h1>Bohrium</h1>
        <p><strong>Bohrium</strong>, symbol <strong>Bh</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 107. It was first synthesized in 1981 by a team of scientists at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. The element is named after the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Bh</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 107</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 270 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 37 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Bohrium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It was created to advance scientific knowledge about superheavy elements. Its discovery added to the study of nuclear physics and atomic structure, particularly at the extreme end of the periodic table.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Bohrium has no known practical applications. It is primarily used for scientific research, especially in nuclear physics, to study the behavior of superheavy elements and the properties of matter at the far end of the periodic table.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Bohrium was named in honor of Niels Bohr, who is known for his work in the development of quantum theory and the atomic model. The naming of the element recognized his legacy in shaping modern physics.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Bohrium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Bohrium is Bohrium-270, with a half-life of about 61 seconds. Other isotopes of Bohrium have even shorter half-lives, making detailed studies of its properties very difficult.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Bohrium are not well understood due to the short half-lives of its isotopes. However, as a Group 7 element, Bohrium is expected to share similar chemical properties with other Group 7 elements like manganese, technetium, and rhenium. Relativistic effects may cause Bohrium to exhibit unique behaviors compared to its lighter counterparts.</p>
