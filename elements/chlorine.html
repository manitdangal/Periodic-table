        <h1>Chlorine</h1>
        <p><strong>Chlorine</strong>, symbol <strong>Cl</strong>, is the seventeenth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 17. It is a halogen and is widely recognized for its distinctive greenish-yellow color and strong, pungent odor. Chlorine is highly reactive and is used in a variety of industrial and chemical applications.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Cl</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 17</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 35.45 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 3.214 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Gas</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> -101.5°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> -34.04°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Chlorine is found abundantly in the Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere. It is part of the Earth's natural halogen cycle and plays an essential role in the formation of salts, including sodium chloride (NaCl), or table salt. Chlorine's reactivity also makes it important in a variety of biological and environmental processes.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Chlorine has a wide range of industrial and household uses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Treatment:</strong> Chlorine is commonly used in water purification and sanitation processes to disinfect drinking water and treat wastewater.</li>
            <li><strong>Production of PVC:</strong> Chlorine is a key element in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a widely used plastic in construction, plumbing, and packaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Bleaching Agent:</strong> Chlorine is used in bleaching and disinfecting products, particularly in the production of paper and textiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Chlorinated Solvents:</strong> Chlorine is used to create chlorinated solvents, which are essential in cleaning, degreasing, and chemical manufacturing.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Chlorine was first isolated in 1774 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. It was initially believed to be a compound, but was later identified as an element due to its unique properties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Chlorine</h2>
        <p>Chlorine has two stable isotopes, which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chlorine-35:</strong> The most abundant isotope, making up about 75% of naturally occurring chlorine.</li>
            <li><strong>Chlorine-37:</strong> A less abundant isotope, comprising about 25% of natural chlorine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Chlorine is a highly reactive halogen that forms a variety of compounds with metals and non-metals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sodium Chloride (NaCl):</strong> Chlorine reacts with sodium to form sodium chloride, a common compound found in salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Chlorine Compounds:</strong> Chlorine reacts with many organic compounds to form chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are important in the manufacture of plastics, solvents, and pesticides.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrogen Chloride (HCl):</strong> Chlorine reacts with hydrogen to form hydrogen chloride, a corrosive gas that is used to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) in industrial processes.</li>
        </ul>
