        <h1>Seaborgium</h1>
        <p><strong>Seaborgium</strong>, symbol <strong>Sg</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 106. It was first synthesized in 1974 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, USA, by a team of scientists. The element is named after Glenn T. Seaborg, a famous American chemist who contributed greatly to the discovery of transuranium elements and the actinide series.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Sg</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 106</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 271 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 35 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Seaborgium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It was created for the advancement of scientific knowledge about superheavy elements and nuclear chemistry. The synthesis of Seaborgium contributed to understanding the chemistry of elements in the actinide series and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Seaborgium has no known practical applications. It is used solely for scientific research, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics and the study of superheavy elements.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Seaborgium was named in honor of Glenn T. Seaborg, a chemist who contributed significantly to the discovery of transuranium elements. His work in the field of nuclear chemistry earned him a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1951.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Seaborgium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Seaborgium is Seaborgium-271, with a half-life of approximately 1.9 minutes. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives, which makes studying their properties challenging.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Seaborgium are not well understood due to the short half-lives of its isotopes. However, as a Group 6 element, Seaborgium is expected to share similar chemical properties with other Group 6 elements such as molybdenum, tungsten, and dubnium. It may also display some unique behaviors due to relativistic effects on its electrons.</p>
