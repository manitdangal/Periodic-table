    <div class="container">
        <h1>Neon</h1>
        <p><strong>Neon</strong>, symbol <strong>Ne</strong>, is the tenth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 10. It is a noble gas, colorless, odorless, and inert, with a reddish-orange glow when used in neon signs. Neon is one of the least reactive elements and is found in small amounts in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Ne</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 10</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 20.180 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 0.9002 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Gas</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> -248.59°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> -246.05°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe by mass, primarily found in stars and nebulae. It is often used in lighting applications due to its ability to emit a bright glow when electrically excited. Neon is also crucial for certain types of lasers, including those used in high-precision surgeries.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Neon has a variety of applications, particularly in the lighting and signage industries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neon Signs:</strong> Neon is most famous for its use in neon signs, which glow brightly in a reddish-orange color when an electric current is passed through the gas.</li>
            <li><strong>High-voltage Indicators:</strong> Neon is used in high-voltage indicators and vacuum tubes due to its ability to glow under electric discharge.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasers:</strong> Neon is used in certain types of gas lasers, such as the helium-neon laser, which is used in applications ranging from barcode scanners to medical surgeries.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising and Decorations:</strong> Neon lighting is also used in art installations, decorations, and advertising displays.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Despite its vibrant glow in neon signs, neon is actually colorless and odorless in its natural state. It only emits light when it is excited by an electrical current.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Neon is a noble gas and is highly inert. It does not form compounds under normal conditions, making it one of the least reactive elements. Some key facts about its chemical behavior include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inertness:</strong> Neon does not react with most elements due to its stable electron configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>Glow:</strong> When an electric current passes through neon gas, it emits a reddish-orange glow due to the excitation of its electrons.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Solubility:</strong> Neon has low solubility in both water and most organic solvents.</li>
        </ul>
