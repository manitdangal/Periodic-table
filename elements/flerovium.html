        <h1>Flerovium</h1>
        <p><strong>Flerovium</strong>, symbol <strong>Fl</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 114. It was first synthesized in 1998 by a collaboration between Russian and American scientists. Flerovium is named in honor of Georgy Flerov, a Russian physicist who contributed significantly to the study of superheavy elements.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Fl</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 114</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 289 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 7 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Flerovium is a very rare and highly unstable element that has only been produced in laboratory conditions. It does not occur naturally on Earth. Its discovery helps expand our understanding of the periodic table and the behavior of superheavy elements, which are studied to understand the limits of atomic stability and the potential for creating even heavier elements.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Flerovium has no known practical applications. Its primary importance lies in the field of nuclear chemistry and physics, where researchers study its properties to understand the behavior of superheavy elements and the possible creation of new elements beyond Flerovium.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Flerovium is named after Georgy Flerov, a Russian physicist who was instrumental in the discovery of many superheavy elements. It is part of the group 14 elements in the periodic table, which also includes carbon, silicon, and lead.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Flerovium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Flerovium is Flerovium-289, which has a half-life of about 2.6 seconds. Other isotopes of Flerovium have even shorter half-lives, on the order of milliseconds.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Because Flerovium is highly unstable and only produced in minute quantities, its chemical properties are not well understood. However, based on its position in Group 14 of the periodic table, it is expected to behave somewhat like other elements in this group, such as lead, but with significant differences due to relativistic effects that influence the behavior of its electrons.</p>
