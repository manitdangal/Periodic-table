        <h1>Chromium</h1>
        <p><strong>Chromium</strong>, symbol <strong>Cr</strong>, is the 24th element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 24. It is a hard, shiny metal with a silvery-white color and is known for its high corrosion resistance and its ability to form colorful compounds.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Cr</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 24</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 52.00 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 7.19 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 1907°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 2671°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Chromium is found in trace amounts in the Earth's crust and plays a role in the formation of some meteors. It is also important for the development of stainless steel and other industrial applications.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Chromium has several important industrial uses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stainless Steel:</strong> Chromium is a key component in making stainless steel, which is widely used in construction, machinery, and kitchen appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Chrome Plating:</strong> Chromium is used in chrome plating for automotive and industrial equipment due to its resistance to corrosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Coloring Agents:</strong> Chromium compounds are used to produce vibrant pigments for paints, dyes, and ceramics.</li>
            <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> Chromium is added to other metals, like steel, to enhance their hardness and resistance to wear and corrosion.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Chromium is named after the Greek word "chroma," meaning color, because many of its compounds are brightly colored, ranging from greens to reds.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Chromium</h2>
        <p>Chromium has several isotopes, but only Chromium-52 is stable and makes up nearly all naturally occurring chromium. Other isotopes are radioactive and have short half-lives.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Chromium readily forms various compounds with oxygen, sulfur, and halogens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chromium Oxides:</strong> Chromium oxides are important for creating pigments and are used in the production of green and red colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Chromium Sulfide (Cr₂S₃):</strong> Used in the production of high-performance alloys.</li>
            <li><strong>Chromium Chloride (CrCl₃):</strong> Used in various chemical reactions and as a catalyst in organic chemistry.</li>
        </ul>
