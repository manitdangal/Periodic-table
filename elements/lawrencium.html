        <h1>Lawrencium</h1>
        <p><strong>Lawrencium</strong>, symbol <strong>Lr</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 103. It was first synthesized in 1958 by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding thorium with boron ions. Lawrencium is named after Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron and a key figure in the development of nuclear physics.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Lr</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 103</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 262 (most stable isotope)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 15.6 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Lawrencium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. It was produced as part of efforts to understand superheavy elements and the nuclear properties of elements beyond uranium. While it has no practical applications due to its extreme rarity, Lawrencium contributes to the study of the chemistry and physics of transuranium elements.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Because of its rarity and instability, Lawrencium has no known practical applications. It is primarily used for scientific research, particularly in nuclear chemistry, where it helps to explore the behavior of superheavy elements and their chemistry, especially those in the actinide series.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Lawrencium is one of the actinide series elements and is produced through nuclear reactions. Its discovery helped expand our understanding of the chemistry of elements heavier than uranium.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Lawrencium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Lawrencium is Lawrencium-262, which has a half-life of about 3.6 hours. Other isotopes of Lawrencium are highly unstable and decay rapidly, making it difficult to study them in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Lawrencium are not well understood due to the short half-life of its isotopes and the difficulty in obtaining measurable amounts. However, as an actinide, Lawrencium is expected to share similarities with other actinide elements, such as having a +3 oxidation state, but it may also display some unique properties due to relativistic effects on its electrons.</p>
