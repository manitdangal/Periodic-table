    <div class="container">
        <h1>Oxygen</h1>
        <p><strong>Oxygen</strong>, symbol <strong>O</strong>, is the eighth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 8. It is a highly reactive non-metal and a vital component of life, forming the basis of respiration for most organisms. Oxygen is colorless, odorless, and tasteless in its molecular form (O₂) and is essential for combustion processes.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> O</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 8</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 15.999 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 1.429 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Gas</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> -218.79°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> -182.96°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe by mass and plays a crucial role in the formation of life-supporting compounds, such as water (H₂O). It is abundant in the Earth's crust and atmosphere and is necessary for the respiration of most organisms. In stars, oxygen plays a key role in the synthesis of heavier elements through stellar nucleosynthesis.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Oxygen is essential for various processes and industries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Respiration:</strong> Oxygen is vital for cellular respiration in animals, plants, and many microorganisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Combustion:</strong> Oxygen is required for combustion, making it essential in fire and energy production.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Use:</strong> Oxygen therapy is used to treat patients with respiratory problems, such as asthma and COPD.</li>
            <li><strong>Steel Production:</strong> Oxygen is used in the Bessemer process to produce steel by removing impurities from molten iron.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Oxygen was first discovered as a distinct element by Joseph Priestley in 1774, although it was later named and understood by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Oxygen is a highly reactive element and forms compounds with most other elements. Some notable compounds include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water (H₂O):</strong> Formed when oxygen reacts with hydrogen, this is essential for life.</li>
            <li><strong>Ozone (O₃):</strong> A molecule made up of three oxygen atoms, which forms the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful UV radiation.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxides:</strong> Oxygen forms various oxides, including carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which are important in environmental chemistry.</li>
        </ul>
