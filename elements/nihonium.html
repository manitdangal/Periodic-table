        <h1>Nihonium</h1>
        <p><strong>Nihonium</strong>, symbol <strong>Nh</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 113. It was first synthesized in 2003 by a team of Japanese scientists at the RIKEN research institute. Nihonium is named after Japan (Nihon), reflecting the country’s contribution to its discovery.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Nh</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 113</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 284 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 6.0 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Nihonium is a highly unstable and synthetic element, and like other superheavy elements, it does not occur naturally on Earth. It was created to expand the periodic table and study the properties of superheavy elements. Its discovery represents a major milestone in nuclear chemistry and the understanding of atomic structure at the limits of stability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>As of now, Nihonium has no known practical applications due to its rarity and extreme instability. Its main importance lies in its role in scientific research, specifically in advancing the study of superheavy elements and nuclear physics.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Nihonium was the first element to be discovered by Japanese scientists, and it was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2016. It is part of the p-block elements in Group 13 of the periodic table, along with boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Nihonium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Nihonium is Nihonium-284, which has a half-life of around 20 milliseconds. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives, making it difficult to study their properties in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Due to its extremely short half-life and the small quantities produced, the chemical properties of Nihonium are not well known. However, based on its position in Group 13 of the periodic table, it is expected to have chemical properties similar to those of other Group 13 elements, such as thallium, with potential differences arising from relativistic effects that influence its electrons at such high atomic numbers.</p>
