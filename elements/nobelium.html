        <h1>Nobelium</h1>
        <p><strong>Nobelium</strong>, symbol <strong>No</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 102. It was first synthesized in 1957 by a team of scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding curium with carbon ions. Nobelium is named in honor of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and the founder of the Nobel Prizes.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> No</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 102</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 259</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 9.4 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Nobelium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally on Earth. It was created as part of scientific efforts to explore superheavy elements and their properties. Nobelium's discovery expanded the understanding of the actinide series and helped to confirm the existence of elements beyond uranium.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Because Nobelium is highly radioactive and only produced in small quantities, it has no practical applications outside of scientific research. It is used primarily in the study of nuclear reactions and superheavy elements. Nobelium has contributed to the ongoing exploration of elements heavier than uranium and the understanding of their chemical behaviors.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>The element Nobelium was named after Alfred Nobel, who left a lasting legacy through the Nobel Prizes, which reward achievements in science, literature, and peace.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Nobelium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Nobelium is Nobelium-259, which has a half-life of about 58 minutes. Other isotopes of Nobelium are highly unstable and decay rapidly, making them difficult to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Nobelium are not fully understood due to the difficulty of obtaining significant quantities for study. However, as a member of the actinide series, Nobelium is expected to exhibit similarities with other actinides, such as having a +3 oxidation state in its compounds. It is also likely to display some relativistic effects on its electrons due to its heavy atomic mass.</p>
