        <h1>Roentgenium</h1>
        <p><strong>Roentgenium</strong>, symbol <strong>Rg</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 111. It was first synthesized in 1994 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany. The element was named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen, who discovered X-rays, to honor his contributions to science.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Rg</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 111</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 280 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 5.4 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Roentgenium is a synthetic, superheavy element that does not occur naturally on Earth. Its discovery expanded the periodic table and helped advance the study of the heaviest known elements. Roentgenium was created as part of research into the properties of elements beyond the actinide series and to understand atomic structure at the edge of stability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Roentgenium has no known practical applications due to its rarity, instability, and the very short half-life of its isotopes. It is mainly used for scientific research, particularly in the study of superheavy elements and nuclear physics, to gain insights into the nature of atomic forces and nuclear stability.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Roentgenium was named after Wilhelm Röntgen, the physicist who discovered X-rays in 1895. The naming honors his groundbreaking discovery, which had a profound impact on medical imaging and science as a whole.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Roentgenium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Roentgenium is Roentgenium-280, which has a half-life of about 2.1 milliseconds. Other isotopes are highly unstable and decay rapidly, making it difficult to study them in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Roentgenium are not well understood due to its extremely short half-life and the minute quantities produced. However, based on its position in Group 11 of the periodic table, it is expected to share similarities with other Group 11 elements such as gold, silver, and copper. It is speculated that Roentgenium may have some unique chemical characteristics due to relativistic effects at its high atomic number.</p>
