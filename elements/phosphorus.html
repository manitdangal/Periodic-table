        <h1>Phosphorus</h1>
        <p><strong>Phosphorus</strong>, symbol <strong>P</strong>, is the fifteenth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 15. It is a non-metal and is commonly found in nature in the form of phosphate rocks. Phosphorus plays an essential role in the chemistry of life, especially in the formation of DNA, RNA, and ATP.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> P</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 15</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 30.974 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 1.82 g/cm³ (white phosphorus)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 44.1°C (white phosphorus)</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 280°C (white phosphorus)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Phosphorus is a critical element for life on Earth, as it is a key component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), ATP (the energy currency of cells), and phospholipids in cell membranes. It is also widely present in the Earth's crust, especially in minerals like apatite.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Phosphorus is used in several important applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Phosphorus is a key component of fertilizers, as it is essential for plant growth and development.</li>
            <li><strong>Detergents:</strong> Phosphates are used in laundry detergents and cleaning products, though their use has been limited due to environmental concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Matches:</strong> White phosphorus is used in match production due to its flammability.</li>
            <li><strong>Metallurgy:</strong> Phosphorus is used in the production of steel and other alloys, improving their hardness and durability.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Phosphorus was discovered in 1669 by German chemist Hennig Brand. It was the first element to be chemically discovered, and its name comes from the Greek word "phosphoros," meaning "light-bearer," due to its characteristic glow in the dark.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Allotropes of Phosphorus</h2>
        <p>Phosphorus exists in several allotropes, each with distinct properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>White Phosphorus:</strong> The most reactive form, which glows faintly in the dark and is highly toxic. It is often stored underwater or in inert gases to prevent combustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Phosphorus:</strong> A more stable form, used in safety matches, fireworks, and certain industrial applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Black Phosphorus:</strong> A rare and less reactive allotrope with metallic properties, used in the development of electronic devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Phosphorus is highly reactive and can form a wide variety of compounds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phosphoric Acid (H₃PO₄):</strong> A common compound used in fertilizers, detergents, and food additives.</li>
            <li><strong>Phosphates:</strong> Phosphates are used in fertilizers and are essential for plant growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Phosphides:</strong> Phosphorus reacts with metals to form phosphides, which are used in semiconductors and certain industrial processes.</li>
        </ul>
