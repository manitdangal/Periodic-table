        <h1>Meitnerium</h1>
        <p><strong>Meitnerium</strong>, symbol <strong>Mt</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 109. It was first synthesized in 1982 by a team of scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The element is named after Lise Meitner, an Austrian-Swedish physicist who contributed significantly to the discovery of nuclear fission.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Mt</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 109</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 278 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 37 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Meitnerium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. Its discovery advanced the understanding of superheavy elements and helped expand the periodic table. Meitnerium, like other elements in the actinide series, was produced for research purposes, particularly in nuclear chemistry and atomic physics.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Meitnerium has no practical applications due to its instability and rarity. It is primarily used for scientific research, particularly to study nuclear reactions and the properties of superheavy elements. Its study contributes to our understanding of the behavior of atoms at the extreme end of the periodic table.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Meitnerium was named in honor of Lise Meitner, who played a key role in the discovery of nuclear fission but was not officially recognized by the Nobel Prize for her work. The naming of the element was a tribute to her contributions to the field of physics and nuclear science.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Meitnerium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Meitnerium is Meitnerium-278, which has a half-life of about 7.6 milliseconds. Other isotopes of Meitnerium are highly unstable and decay rapidly, making it difficult to study in depth.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Meitnerium are not well understood due to the short half-life of its isotopes. However, as a Group 9 element, Meitnerium is expected to share some chemical characteristics with other Group 9 elements like cobalt, rhodium, and iridium. However, due to relativistic effects, it may exhibit some unique chemical behaviors compared to its lighter congeners.</p>
