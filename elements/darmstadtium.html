        <h1>Darmstadtium</h1>
        <p><strong>Darmstadtium</strong>, symbol <strong>Ds</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 110. It was first synthesized in 1994 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, where it was named after the city of Darmstadt.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Ds</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 110</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 281 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 32 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Darmstadtium is a synthetic element that does not naturally occur on Earth. Its discovery expanded the periodic table and provided insight into the properties of superheavy elements. Darmstadtium was created by nuclear fusion reactions and is used primarily for research in nuclear physics and chemistry, as it has an extremely short half-life.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Darmstadtium has no known practical applications due to its rarity, instability, and short half-life. It is primarily used for scientific research, particularly in the study of superheavy elements and their properties, contributing to our understanding of nuclear physics and atomic theory.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Darmstadtium is named after the city of Darmstadt, Germany, where it was first synthesized. The element's discovery at the GSI Helmholtz Centre helped expand the frontiers of nuclear chemistry and physics by adding another element to the heaviest known elements on the periodic table.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Darmstadtium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Darmstadtium is Darmstadtium-281, which has a half-life of around 12.7 milliseconds. Other isotopes are highly unstable and decay rapidly, making detailed studies of their properties difficult.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Darmstadtium are not well understood due to the extremely short half-lives of its isotopes. However, as a Group 10 element, it is expected to share some chemical properties with other elements in the group, such as platinum, palladium, and nickel. However, relativistic effects may cause Darmstadtium to behave somewhat differently from its lighter congeners.</p>
