        <h1>Argon</h1>
        <p><strong>Argon</strong>, symbol <strong>Ar</strong>, is the eighteenth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 18. It is a noble gas and is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Argon is chemically inert, meaning it does not easily form compounds with other elements.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Ar</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 18</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 39.948 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 1.784 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Gas</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> -189.34°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> -185.85°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Argon is the third most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere, making up about 0.93% by volume. It is found in trace amounts throughout the universe and plays an important role in the geologic and atmospheric processes of Earth. Argon is also used to isolate certain reactions by providing an inert atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Argon has several important applications in various industries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Welding:</strong> Argon is widely used in arc welding and other industrial processes where an inert atmosphere is necessary to prevent oxidation of the materials being welded.</li>
            <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Argon is used in incandescent light bulbs and fluorescent tubes to prevent the filament from burning away.</li>
            <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Argon is used to create inert atmospheres for the preservation of historical documents and artworks.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Uses:</strong> Argon is used in cryosurgery to treat certain medical conditions by freezing tissue.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Argon was discovered in 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay. Its name comes from the Greek word "argos," meaning "inactive," due to its inertness in chemical reactions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Argon</h2>
        <p>Argon has several isotopes, with two of them being stable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Argon-36:</strong> The most abundant isotope of Argon.</li>
            <li><strong>Argon-40:</strong> A stable isotope formed by the decay of potassium-40, used in radiometric dating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Argon is chemically inert and does not form many compounds. However, under extreme conditions, such as in high-energy collisions or reactions with other noble gases, argon can form compounds, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Argon Fluoride (ArF):</strong> A rare compound that can form when argon reacts with fluorine.</li>
        </ul>
