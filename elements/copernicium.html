        <h1>Copernicium</h1>
        <p><strong>Copernicium</strong>, symbol <strong>Cn</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 112. It was first synthesized in 1996 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany. Copernicium is named in honor of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Cn</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 112</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 285 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 15 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Copernicium is a highly unstable and synthetic element, which means it does not occur naturally on Earth. It was created in a laboratory as part of research into the synthesis of superheavy elements. Its discovery helps expand the periodic table and contributes to the study of atomic theory and nuclear physics, especially as scientists explore the limits of atomic stability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Currently, Copernicium has no known practical applications due to its rarity, instability, and the small quantities in which it is produced. However, it is important for scientific research, particularly in the study of superheavy elements and their properties, which can offer insights into nuclear structure and atomic behavior.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Copernicium was named after Nicolaus Copernicus, the astronomer who proposed that the Earth revolves around the Sun, a revolutionary idea in the history of science. Copernicium is a part of the transition metals in Group 12 of the periodic table, which includes zinc, cadmium, and mercury.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Copernicium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Copernicium is Copernicium-285, which has a half-life of approximately 29 seconds. Other isotopes of Copernicium have even shorter half-lives, making them difficult to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Since Copernicium is produced in only minute amounts and decays quickly, its chemical properties are not well understood. However, it is believed to have chemical properties similar to other elements in Group 12, such as mercury and zinc. Due to relativistic effects, it may exhibit differences from its lighter congeners, potentially having a more metallic character.</p>
