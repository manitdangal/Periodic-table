        <h1>Rutherfordium</h1>
        <p><strong>Rutherfordium</strong>, symbol <strong>Rf</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 104. It was first synthesized in 1964 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by bombarding plutonium with neon ions. It was named in honor of physicist Ernest Rutherford, who is considered one of the fathers of nuclear physics.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Rf</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 104</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 267 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 23 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Rutherfordium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It was created to further research into superheavy elements and their properties. Its discovery helped confirm the position of the element in the periodic table and expand our knowledge of the chemistry of elements beyond uranium.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Rutherfordium has no known practical applications. It is used primarily for scientific research, particularly in the field of nuclear physics and chemistry, to study the properties of superheavy elements and their behavior in the periodic table.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Rutherfordium was named after Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the concept of nuclear decay and the structure of the atom. His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Rutherfordium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Rutherfordium is Rutherfordium-267, which has a half-life of about 1.3 hours. Other isotopes have even shorter half-lives, making them very difficult to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Rutherfordium’s chemical properties are not fully understood due to its short half-life and the challenges in producing large enough amounts of the element. However, as a Group 4 element, Rutherfordium is expected to share chemical properties with other Group 4 elements like titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Its chemistry may also exhibit relativistic effects on its electrons, similar to other superheavy elements.</p>
