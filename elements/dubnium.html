        <h1>Dubnium</h1>
        <p><strong>Dubnium</strong>, symbol <strong>Db</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 105. It was first synthesized in 1967 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. The element is named after the Russian town of Dubna, where it was discovered, in recognition of the contribution to nuclear chemistry by the Russian scientific community.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Db</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 105</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 268 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 34 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Dubnium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It was created to further scientific research into the properties of superheavy elements. The synthesis of Dubnium helped expand our knowledge of the chemistry and nuclear properties of elements beyond uranium.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Dubnium has no known practical applications. It is primarily used for scientific research, particularly in nuclear physics, to explore the behavior of superheavy elements and test theories about the periodic table's outermost elements.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Dubnium was named after the Russian town of Dubna, where the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) was instrumental in its discovery. This naming honors the significant role of Russian scientists in the field of nuclear chemistry.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Dubnium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Dubnium is Dubnium-268, which has a half-life of approximately 29 hours. Other isotopes have shorter half-lives, which make them challenging to study in detail.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Dubnium are not well understood due to the short half-lives of its isotopes. However, as a Group 5 element, Dubnium is expected to share some chemical properties with other Group 5 elements like vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Its chemistry is likely to exhibit unique behaviors because of relativistic effects on its electrons.</p>
