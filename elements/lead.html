        <h1>Lead</h1>
        <p><strong>Lead</strong>, symbol <strong>Pb</strong>, is a heavy metal with atomic number 82. It is soft, malleable, and dense, with a long history of use in various applications, despite its known toxicity to humans and animals.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Pb</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 82</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 207.2</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 11.34 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 327.5 °C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 1,740 °C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Lead is formed in stars and is present in the Earth's crust. It has been used for thousands of years, particularly for construction materials and as a protective shield against radiation. However, lead's toxicity has led to a decrease in its use in modern applications.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead-Acid Batteries:</strong> Lead is used in lead-acid batteries for cars and other vehicles, where its high density and low cost are advantageous.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiation Shielding:</strong> Lead is commonly used to shield against radiation in medical and industrial settings due to its high atomic number.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction and Plumbing:</strong> Lead has historically been used in pipes and roofing materials, though its use has decreased due to its toxicity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Lead was used by ancient Romans in pipes, as well as in cosmetics, and it was known to be highly toxic even back then.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Lead</h2>
        <p>Lead has four stable isotopes, with Lead-206 being the most abundant. It is also used in radiometric dating, particularly in determining the age of rocks and minerals.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Lead is resistant to corrosion, forming a protective oxide layer on its surface. It reacts with acids to form lead salts, such as lead(II) chloride, which are used in various industrial processes. However, its toxicity makes handling lead compounds dangerous.</p>
