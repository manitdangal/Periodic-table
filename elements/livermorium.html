        <h1>Livermorium</h1>
        <p><strong>Livermorium</strong>, symbol <strong>Lv</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 116. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table and is one of the heaviest elements known. Livermorium was first synthesized in 2000 by a collaboration of Russian and American scientists and is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, USA.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Lv</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 116</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 293 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 4.9–5.1 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Livermorium is a very rare and highly unstable element that is not found in nature. It was synthesized in a laboratory, and only a few atoms have been produced. Livermorium's discovery pushes the boundaries of the periodic table, expanding our knowledge of superheavy elements and helping scientists study the limits of nuclear stability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Livermorium has no known practical applications. It is primarily studied by scientists for its role in understanding the chemistry and properties of superheavy elements, as well as the synthesis of new elements.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Livermorium is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which played a key role in its discovery. It is one of the heaviest elements on the periodic table and has only been produced in small amounts in laboratory conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Livermorium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Livermorium is Livermorium-293, which has a half-life of around 60 milliseconds. Other isotopes are even more unstable and have even shorter half-lives.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Because of its short half-life and the limited number of atoms produced, the chemical properties of Livermorium are not well understood. However, it is expected to behave similarly to other elements in the chalcogen group (Group 16), though relativistic effects (due to its heavy atomic mass) may cause some unique properties compared to lighter chalcogens like polonium and tellurium.</p>
