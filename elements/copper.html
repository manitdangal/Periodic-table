        <h1>Copper</h1>
        <p><strong>Copper</strong>, symbol <strong>Cu</strong>, is the 29th element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 29. It is a reddish-brown metal that is highly valued for its excellent electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. Copper has been used by humans for thousands of years in various applications.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Cu</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 29</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 63.546 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 8.96 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 1085°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 2562°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Copper is one of the oldest metals known to humans, and it is essential for the biological function of many organisms. It is also found in stars and meteorites, and it plays a role in the formation of planets.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Copper is widely used due to its excellent properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electrical Wiring:</strong> Copper is the primary material used in electrical wires due to its superior conductivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Coins:</strong> Copper has historically been used in coinage, especially in pennies.</li>
            <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> Copper is used to make alloys such as bronze and brass, which are used in coins, jewelry, and musical instruments.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Copper is also used in plumbing and roofing due to its resistance to corrosion.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Copper has been used for over 10,000 years, with ancient civilizations using it for tools, coins, and decoration. The word "copper" is derived from the Latin "cuprum," meaning "from the island of Cyprus," where copper was mined.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Copper</h2>
        <p>Copper has two stable isotopes, Copper-63 and Copper-65. Copper-63 is more abundant, while Copper-65 is used in some industrial applications, including in the production of radiopharmaceuticals.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Copper reacts with oxygen to form a green patina (copper oxide) when exposed to air over time. It also reacts with acids to form copper salts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Copper Sulfate (CuSO₄):</strong> Used in agriculture as a fungicide and in electroplating.</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Chloride (CuCl₂):</strong> Used in the production of chemicals and as a catalyst in some reactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Copper Oxide (CuO):</strong> Used in batteries, pigments, and as a catalyst in chemical reactions.</li>
        </ul>
