        <h1>Calcium</h1>
        <p><strong>Calcium</strong>, symbol <strong>Ca</strong>, is the 20th element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 20. It is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is essential for living organisms. Calcium is most commonly found in the Earth's crust and is crucial for biological functions.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Ca</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 20</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 40.078 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 1.54 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 842°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 1484°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and is essential for life. It is found in a variety of minerals such as limestone, gypsum, and dolomite. In space, calcium is produced in large stars during the later stages of their evolution and is a key component of planetary bodies.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Calcium has several important uses both in industrial applications and biological systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bone and Teeth Health:</strong> Calcium is a major component of bones and teeth, making it essential for maintaining bone density and strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Cement and Concrete:</strong> Calcium compounds like calcium oxide (lime) and calcium carbonate (chalk) are crucial in the production of cement and concrete.</li>
            <li><strong>Metallurgy:</strong> Calcium is used as a reducing agent in the production of metals such as thorium and uranium.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Additive:</strong> Calcium is added to certain foods and supplements to help prevent bone loss and calcium deficiencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Calcium was first isolated in 1808 by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of lime. It plays a critical role in muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting in the human body.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Calcium</h2>
        <p>Calcium has several isotopes, the most stable and naturally occurring of which are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calcium-40:</strong> The most abundant isotope, making up about 96.9% of naturally occurring calcium.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium-42:</strong> A stable isotope with an abundance of about 0.6%.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium-43:</strong> Another stable isotope, with a small natural abundance of 0.135%.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium-44:</strong> A stable isotope with an abundance of about 2.1%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Calcium is highly reactive, particularly with water, and readily forms compounds with other elements. Some of its key chemical properties include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃):</strong> Commonly found in rocks, shells, and pearls. It is used in construction materials and as a dietary supplement.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂):</strong> Known as slaked lime, it is used in water treatment and as an antacid.</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂):</strong> Used as a de-icer on roads and in various industrial processes.</li>
        </ul>
