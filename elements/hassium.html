        <h1>Hassium</h1>
        <p><strong>Hassium</strong>, symbol <strong>Hs</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 108. It was first synthesized in 1984 by a team of scientists at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany. The element is named after the German state of Hesse, where Darmstadt is located.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Hs</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 108</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 277 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 40 g/cmÂ³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Hassium is a synthetic element and does not naturally occur. Its discovery expanded the periodic table and contributed to the understanding of superheavy elements. Hassium was produced through nuclear reactions and is important for nuclear chemistry and atomic physics research.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Hassium has no known practical applications. It is primarily used for scientific research, especially in the study of superheavy elements, nuclear chemistry, and the effects of relativistic electron behavior in heavy atoms.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Hassium was named after the German state of Hesse, where the element was first synthesized. The research team at GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research succeeded in creating Hassium through a fusion reaction between lead and iron nuclei.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Hassium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Hassium is Hassium-277, with a half-life of about 9.4 milliseconds. Other isotopes are even more unstable and decay very quickly, making detailed studies of their properties extremely challenging.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>The chemical properties of Hassium are not well understood due to the short half-lives of its isotopes. As a Group 8 element, it is expected to share some chemical properties with other Group 8 elements, such as osmium and iridium. However, relativistic effects may cause Hassium to behave differently from its lighter congeners.</p>
