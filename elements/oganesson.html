        <h1>Oganesson</h1>
        <p><strong>Oganesson</strong>, symbol <strong>Og</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 118. It is a member of the noble gases group and is one of the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Oganesson is highly unstable, and only a few atoms have been produced in laboratories.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Og</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 118</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 294 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 4.9–5.1 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely gas (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Oganesson is extremely rare and has only been synthesized in laboratories. It is not found naturally on Earth, and its short half-life makes it difficult to study. It is believed to be a very dense and heavy noble gas, though its chemical properties remain largely theoretical due to its instability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Due to its extreme rarity and instability, Oganesson has no known practical applications. It is mainly of interest to scientists studying the properties of superheavy elements and the limits of the periodic table.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Oganesson is named after Yuri Oganessian, a Russian physicist who contributed significantly to the discovery of superheavy elements. It is one of the heaviest elements known to science.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Oganesson</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Oganesson is Oganesson-294, which has a half-life of around 0.89 milliseconds. Other isotopes are less stable and have even shorter half-lives.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Because only a few atoms of Oganesson have been synthesized, its chemical properties are not fully understood. It is predicted to behave as a noble gas, similar to other elements in Group 18 of the periodic table, but its heavier mass and potential relativistic effects may lead to some unique behavior.</p>
