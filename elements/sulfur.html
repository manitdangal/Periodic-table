        <h1>Sulfur</h1>
        <p><strong>Sulfur</strong>, symbol <strong>S</strong>, is the sixteenth element in the periodic table with an atomic number of 16. It is a non-metal and is known for its bright yellow color and strong odor when in its compounds. Sulfur plays a crucial role in various biochemical processes and is an essential element for life on Earth.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> S</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 16</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 32.06 amu</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 2.067 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 115.21°C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 444.6°C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Sulfur is abundant in the universe, especially in stars, comets, and some planetary atmospheres. On Earth, it is essential for life, as it is a component of amino acids and vitamins. Sulfur compounds also play a role in various biochemical cycles, such as the sulfur cycle, which is important for the environment.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Sulfur has many important industrial applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Sulfur is a key component in fertilizers, particularly as a part of ammonium sulfate and superphosphate fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Sulfur compounds are used in the production of antibiotics and in the treatment of various diseases, including skin conditions like acne.</li>
            <li><strong>Sulfuric Acid:</strong> Sulfur is used in the production of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), which is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals, involved in cleaning, etching, and the manufacture of fertilizers and detergents.</li>
            <li><strong>Rubber Industry:</strong> Sulfur is used in the vulcanization process of rubber to improve its durability and elasticity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Sulfur was known to ancient civilizations, and the Egyptians used it in the embalming process. It has also been used for thousands of years in medicine and industry due to its wide range of useful properties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Allotropes of Sulfur</h2>
        <p>Sulfur exists in several allotropes, each with distinct properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rhombic Sulfur:</strong> The most stable form at room temperature, consisting of a yellow, crystalline substance.</li>
            <li><strong>Monoclinic Sulfur:</strong> A less stable form that can be produced by heating rhombic sulfur and then cooling it quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic Sulfur:</strong> An amorphous form of sulfur, produced by rapidly cooling molten sulfur.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Sulfur readily reacts with many elements to form a variety of compounds, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S):</strong> A toxic, flammable gas with a characteristic rotten egg smell. It is produced during the decay of organic matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂):</strong> A gas that is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and is also used in food preservation and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid.</li>
            <li><strong>Sulfates:</strong> Sulfur forms sulfates when it reacts with oxygen, which are important components of many minerals and are commonly found in industrial processes.</li>
        </ul>
