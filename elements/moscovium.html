        <h1>Moscovium</h1>
        <p><strong>Moscovium</strong>, symbol <strong>Mc</strong>, is a synthetic element with atomic number 115. It is a member of the p-block elements and was first synthesized in 2003 by a team of Russian and American scientists. Moscovium was named in honor of Moscow, Russia, acknowledging the contributions of Russian scientists to its discovery.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Mc</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 115</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 288 (estimated)</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> Estimated to be around 4.9–5.1 g/cm³ (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Likely solid (theoretical)</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Unknown</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Moscovium is an extremely rare and highly unstable element that has only been synthesized in laboratory conditions. It does not occur naturally on Earth. Its discovery helps to expand our understanding of superheavy elements and the limits of atomic stability.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Currently, Moscovium has no known practical applications due to its extreme rarity and instability. It is primarily studied for its role in advancing nuclear chemistry and understanding the properties of superheavy elements. Research into Moscovium also contributes to the broader scientific effort to synthesize even heavier elements.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Moscovium was named after Moscow to honor the city and Russian scientists who were instrumental in its discovery. It is one of the heaviest elements and has only been produced in small quantities under highly controlled conditions in laboratories.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Moscovium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotope of Moscovium is Moscovium-288, which has a half-life of around 0.8 milliseconds. Other isotopes of Moscovium are even more unstable, with shorter half-lives.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Because Moscovium is highly unstable and only produced in minuscule amounts, its chemical properties are not well understood. However, based on its position in the periodic table, it is expected to behave similarly to other elements in Group 15 (the nitrogen group), such as bismuth, but it may exhibit unique properties due to relativistic effects, which influence the behavior of its electrons.</p>
