        <h1>Cerium</h1>
        <p><strong>Cerium</strong>, symbol <strong>Ce</strong>, is a chemical element with atomic number 58. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that belongs to the lanthanide series of the periodic table. Cerium is named after the dwarf planet Ceres, which was discovered around the same time as the element.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Ce</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 58</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 140.12</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 6.77 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 798 °C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 3,440 °C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Cerium is the most abundant of the rare earth elements and is found in several minerals such as bastnäsite and monazite. It plays an important role in many industrial applications and is essential in catalysts for automotive exhaust systems. Its compounds are also used in the manufacturing of glass, carbon arc lamps, and as a catalyst in petroleum refining.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <p>Cerium is widely used in a range of applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Catalysts:</strong> It is used in catalytic converters to reduce vehicle emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Glass Manufacturing:</strong> Cerium oxide is used to polish optical glass and in glass production to remove the greenish tint caused by iron impurities.</li>
            <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> Cerium is added to steel and other alloys to improve their properties, particularly in high-temperature applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Cerium is often used in lighter flints because it is highly reactive. It also plays a role in certain types of nuclear reactors due to its ability to absorb neutrons.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Cerium</h2>
        <p>The most stable isotopes of Cerium are Cerium-140 and Cerium-142. Other isotopes are radioactive with relatively short half-lives. The element’s isotopes have been studied extensively for their properties in various scientific fields, including nuclear physics and chemistry.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Cerium has two main oxidation states: +3 and +4. The +4 state is more stable in compounds such as cerium dioxide (CeO₂), which is used as a catalyst and in various chemical processes. Cerium compounds are also known for their ability to absorb oxygen, making them useful in oxidation reactions.</p>
