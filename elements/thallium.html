        <h1>Thallium</h1>
        <p><strong>Thallium</strong>, symbol <strong>Tl</strong>, is a post-transition metal with atomic number 81. It is a soft, malleable metal known for its toxicity and its use in semiconductors, electronic devices, and certain chemical applications.</p>

        <h2>General Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Tl</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> 81</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Mass:</strong> 204.38</li>
            <li><strong>Density:</strong> 11.85 g/cm³</li>
            <li><strong>State at Room Temperature:</strong> Solid</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Point:</strong> 304 °C</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 1,457 °C</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in the Universe</h2>
        <p>Thallium is formed in stars and is found in trace amounts in the Earth's crust. Despite its toxicity, it has several important uses in industry, electronics, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

        <h2>Key Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Thallium compounds are used in semiconductors, particularly in devices like photodetectors and infrared detectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Electronic Devices:</strong> Thallium is used in the production of low-melting point glass and some electrical components.</li>
            <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Thallium sulfate has historically been used in the treatment of ringworm and other infections, though its use has decreased due to toxicity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Thallium was once used as a rat poison, but its highly toxic nature led to its discontinuation for that purpose.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Isotopes of Thallium</h2>
        <p>Thallium has two stable isotopes: Thallium-203 and Thallium-205. Thallium-201 is also used in medical imaging, particularly in myocardial scans.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Thallium is highly toxic, and its compounds are dangerous to humans and animals. It forms Thallium(I) and Thallium(III) compounds, both of which are used in various chemical reactions, including as catalysts in certain reactions.</p>
